Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Objective

Learn how to implement and use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for both linear and non-linear classification.

Tools

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Matplotlib

Steps

Load and prepare a dataset for binary classification (Breast Cancer Dataset).

Train an SVM with:

Linear kernel

RBF kernel

Visualize decision boundary using 2D data.

Tune hyperparameters such as C and gamma.

Use cross-validation to evaluate performance.

Dataset

Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (from sklearn.datasets)
